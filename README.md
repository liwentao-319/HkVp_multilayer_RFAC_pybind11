# Project Name
Sequential RF-AC H-k Phase-weighted Stacking

# Descriptions
Sequential RF-AC H-k Phase-weighted Stacking utilize the seismic converted phases from Receiver Functions and the seismic reflected phases from coda Autocorrelations of teleseismic P-waves to constrain the thicknesses and Vp/Vs ratios of the sediments and the underlying crust. It is a powerfull tool to analyze the complex converted phases in RFs in presence of the low-velocity sediments. 


# Prerequisites
Numpy, Matplotlib, Obspy

# Installation Steps
